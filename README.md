#  In-Vehicle Coupon Exploratory Data Analysis Project
## Business context
To determine if a driver will accept a coupon while driving, factors like proximity, establishment type, passengers, weather, and time of day can influence their decision. Analyzing a driver's profile and history can predict their response, helping companies offer the right coupon to increase business and customer satisfaction. It's important to consider all factors when deciding to accept a coupon.

# Exploratory Data Analysis
Analyzing available data is crucial in data science case studies. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) helps visualize data accurately and identify important features for data preprocessing and model selection.

After analyzing the provided dataset, I followed the data-cleaning process to cleanse the data. I used various simple visualizations to better understand the data and to identify outliers. I then explored the data for interesting questions related to Coupon categories and other influencing parameters, by visualizing data using ploting libraries.
